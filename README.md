An overview of the most important files and directories is provided below:

- [`design/`](design) contains files relevant to the survey design, including a printable summary of the entire survey ([`design/survey_printable.pdf`](design/survey_printable.pdf)), a simplified schematic of the survey workflow ([`design/survey_design_overview.pdf`](design/survey_design_overview.pdf)) and all exported LimeSurvey template files.
- [`email_retrieval.Rmd`](email_retrieval.Rmd) and [`email_cleaning.Rmd`](email_cleaning.Rmd) document the processes used to retrieve email addresses of corresponding authors of  [bioRxiv](https://biorxiv.org) preprints from the bioRxiv platform, and clean/validate  those addresses for inviting to participate in the survey. Note that raw email addresses have not been included in this dataset.
- [`main_analysis.Rmd`](main_analysis.Rmd) documents the main analysis of survey responses, including the generation of all figures shown in the manuscript.
- [`regression_analysis.Rmd`](regression_analysis.Rmd) documents the ordinal logistic regression analysis on survey response data as documented in the manuscript.
- [`data/`](data) contains anonymised survey response data ( [`data/response_data_anonymised.csv`](data/response_data_anonymised.csv)). Note that free-text comments have been removed from this dataset to prevent participant identification.
- [`outputs/figures/`](outputs/figures) contains all figures (in .png format) generated from [`main_analysis.Rmd`](main_analysis.Rmd).
